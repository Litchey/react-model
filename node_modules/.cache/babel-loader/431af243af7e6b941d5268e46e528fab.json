Let us start from the basics.<br />\r\n              Bitcoin/Cryptocurrency mining is the process by which new bitcoins are\r\n              entered into circulation, but it is also a critical process for the\r\n              maintenance and development of the blockchain ledger.<br />\r\n              It is performed using very sophisticated computer hardware that solves\r\n              extremely complex computational problems.<br />\r\n              Another process of mining is to secure transactions between 2 blocks\r\n              by verifying it so that there is no mistake or fraud taking place\r\n              making every blockchain transaction the most secure compared to other\r\n              networks of banking transactions.\r\n            </p>\r\n         \r\n            <h2>What is the Process ?</h2>\r\n            <p>\r\n              The process involves numerous components and hardwares. <br/>\r\n          One Main Component which acts as a lead for the whole process is either a GPU (graphics processing unit) or an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) . \r\n          The GPU once setup along with the other components works for the blockchain and generates revenue in the form of rewards which are converted into coins. \r\n          Such coins can be sold and exchanged to USD/INR or any currency\r\n            </p>\r\n            <h2>What do we do ?</h2>\r\n            <p>\r\n              We Provide a Complete Mining Package no matter where you are, your hardware will work for you. <br/>\r\n              All you need to do is choose and purchase your graphics card from the “Pricing” section.<br/>\r\n              We will set up all the other components and run the whole rig for you. \r\n            </p>\r\n            <h2>How much does it cost ?</h2>\r\n            <p>\r\n              Graphic Cards used for mining cost as low as USD 650 / INR 50,000 each based on market availability. <br/>\r\n              <b> *Minimum of 5 Cards is required per build*<br/>\r\n               *You can contact us with your budget and we can figure out the best deal for you, we do not make profit out of the graphics card, our motive is to bring down the ROI Period, which can be done only if we procure the graphics card at a good price*</b>\r\n               <br/>\r\n               \r\n               There will be a one Time Payment of 100 USD / INR 7500 for each card. \r\n               This amount is chargeable for every additional card purchased. \r\n               This Payment will be for the Components like the Motherboard, Powersupply and to get everything set up and running for you. \r\n            </p>\r\n           <h2>What coin do we mine ?</h2>\r\n           <p>We mine coins which are most profitable only. <br/>\r\n            We can also mine coins requested by the Investors.<br/><br/>\r\n            \r\n            The coins we mine are : <br/>\r\n            Ethereum<br/>\r\n            Ergo <br/>\r\n            RavenCoin <br/>\r\n            Conflux<br/>\r\n            Flux</p>\r\n            <h2>How does it work ?</h2>\r\n            <p>  Select the Card you want to Mine with and make payment for the cards.<br/>\r\n              Setting up can take upto 48 hours.<br/>\r\n              Once the Rig is set up the Mining Process will start within 24 hours. <br/>\r\n              You can track down every single detail of the process, we will provide you with the link to check what your card is currently mining and how much it is making per day, per week and per month. <br/>\r\n              Every Month your card will work only for 21 days. <br/>\r\n              The first 9 days of the month your card will work for us which will cover for the electricity and maintenance. <br/>\r\n              There will be quarterly Maintenance shutdown for 3 days to make sure every graphic card is performing at its best. <br/>\r\n              Every detail will be updated to you beforehand through a whatsapp message. </p>\r\n              <h2>What is the Return on Investment like ?</h2>\r\n              <p> The Return on Investment in our Crypto mining project is unlike any other traditional business, we take investments which have an ROI of 12 Months or below only. \r\n                We give you complete control over what you do to the funds which is upto you to decide if you want to hold them or trade with them or withdraw them to your bank account.</p>\r\n<h2>How does ROI work ? ( USD ) </h2>\r\n<p> For Example : <br/><br/>\r\n\r\n  RTX 3060 Costs Approximately 800 USD ( Subject to changes ) <br/>\r\n  On this date the returns are 3.2 USD per day. ( Subject to changes ) <br/>\r\n  Your Return on Investment will be in 250 days / 8.3 months <br/><br/>\r\n  \r\n  This project is for a time period of 3.3 Years / 40 Months <br/>\r\n  So Investing 800 USD for a RTX 3060 should leave you with 2640 USD at the end of the project. <br/>\r\n  *This Prediction is calculated based on 30 working days per month*   <br/><br/>\r\n  \r\n  This is based on the current market valuation, there are huge potential chances for increase in coin value which can even make 10x what you hold. <br/><br/>\r\n  \r\n  The returns on the card completely depend on the market fluctuations but the minimum income is always provided and guaranteed . <br/>\r\n  Due to the fluctuation in the prices of the cards and also the coin value, we estimate every investment to be returned in 10-13 months. \r\n  Which is around 8% per month.</p>\r\n<h2>Why Choose this instead of Investing in Bitcoin ?</h2>\r\n<p> If cryptocurrency is the future, mining is the base of it.<br/><br/>\r\n \r\n  1) The Graphics card we purchase comes under an asset category, It is an electronic product and does degrade in value as the time goes but it constantly generates revenue for 3 Years.<br/>\r\n  2) Investing directly into cryptocurrency will not give you any returns unless the value of it goes up. Mining Provides a constant income.<br/>\r\n  3) Freedom and control over everything. At any point of time in the 3 years if there is a big change in the cryptocurrency market or coins are out of value, CC Mining Solutions LLC will sell the cards on your behalf to recoup the money which will be credited back to you after taking your confirmation. CC Mining solely decides the value of the cards and the amount to be refunded to avoid any confusion and misunderstanding. This is something that happens only as a last resort.</p>\r\n<h2>Portfolio Building</h2>\r\n<p>If you are looking to invest into crypto currency but you are very skeptical, this is your best shot to build your crypto portfolio. You can consider this project investment as your crypto portfolio investment as you not only trust  the digital currency but also have hardware to back you up if things go sideways</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\">  Disclaimer  \r\n\t\t\t\t</h5>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p > \r\n          <li style=\"padding: 7px;\"> Mining of Cryptocurrency is stable but the income changes to any value and we do not have any control over it. </li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<li style=\"padding: 7px;\"> The ROI period given is based on the current market, it can change over time.</li>\r\n            <li style=\"padding: 7px;\"> \tAt any point of time if there is an issue/repair with your mining hardware we will need to send it to the manufacturer for warranty which happens in extremely rare cases. During that time until we get a replaced card, the mining process will be on halt, The replaced card will be brand new . There are no repairs for these cards, only replacement. All Cards come with a 3 Years Warranty.</li>\r\n              <li style=\"padding: 7px;\"> \tWe use 94% Efficient HP Platinum Power Supplies to power the graphics cards which is the safest in the market. Any Damage to the card that does not cover warranty will not be borne by us even though properly maintained cards run for upto 4-5 years there is a 0.1% chance of electrical failure/ short circuit. </li>\r\n                <li style=\"padding: 7px;\"> \tThe Cards will be owned by the company, to make sure that the client/investor is not disturbed if there is a process of RMA or Replacement for the cards. </li>\r\n                  <li style=\"padding: 7px;\"> \tThis Project is a contract for 3.3 Years / 40 Months only.

Power Cuts are not very common but there are Planned power outages once a month.
